# Clock and Simple Recursion
As instructed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wIcWr4Q6M8O0AZKJ5V_OxxabMd3N2pV_HjrF87ZMSvA/edit?pli=1). As for my thoughts on this assignment, the first one was easy and simple while the second one was significantly harder and took me more time to accomplish.

## 1
Negates invalid user input and only allows valid hours and minutes. Uses a simple clock angle formula.

## 2
Each branch object has a list of children branch, a unique name identifier, a reference to its parent branch and an add branch method. This console program also has a calculate depth method that uses a simple recursion pattern.
